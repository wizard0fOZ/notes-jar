You’re doing your best. That’s enough.
---
This stress doesn’t define you.
---
You are capable. Full stop.
---
One step. Then another.
---
I believe in you more than you doubt yourself.
---
You’ve got a strong brain and an even stronger heart.
---
This moment will pass.
---
You are bigger than this assignment.
---
Breathe in. Breathe out. Keep going.
---
You don’t have to be perfect to succeed.
---
You’ve handled tougher days.
---
I’m proud of you for trying.
---
Even overwhelmed, you’re impressive.
---
Soon this will just be a memory.
---
After you submit, we celebrate. Deal.
